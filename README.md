# Lamport's Bakery Algorithm

---

## Overview

The Lamport's Bakery Algorithm is a synchronization algorithm designed to solve the critical section problem, ensuring mutual exclusion in concurrent systems. It was proposed by computer scientist Leslie Lamport in 1974. This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple threads or processes compete for shared resources.
